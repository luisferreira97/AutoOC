"""

This fitness function is for a sequence-match problem: we're given
an integer sequence target, say [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5], and we try to synthesize a
program (loops, if-statements, etc) which will *yield* that sequence,
one item at a time.

There are several components of the fitness:

1. concerning the program:
    i. length of the program (shorter is better)
    ii. compressibility of the program (non-compressible, ie DRY, is better)

2. concerning distance from the target:
    i. dynamic time warping distance from the program's output to the target
    (lower is better).
    ii. Levenshtein distance from the program's output to the target
    (lower is better).
