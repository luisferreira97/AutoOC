"""Latent-Tree GE (LTGE)

Alberto Moraglio and James McDermott 2018.

This is still GE, with integer genomes, but integers arranged in a
dictionary. In the dictionary of key-value pairs, each key is a list
of tuples representing a path from the root to the node, and the
corresponding value is an integer which (still) represents the choice
of production made at the node. We call it latent tree GE because the
representation itself is "flat" (a dictionary) but the derivation tree
is implicit or latent.

Example genome with interpretation:

{
(): 8, # at the root, choice 8 was made
((8, 1),): 5, # for the first symbol in choice 8, choice 5 was made
((8, 1), (5, 1)): 4,
((8, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1)): 9
}


The initialisation operator in LTGE is equivalent to that in GE.
The mutation operator is equivalent to the CFG-GP mutation.  The
crossover operator is equivalent to a homologous crossover on
derivation trees.
